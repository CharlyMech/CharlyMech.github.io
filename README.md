### What did I use for this portfolio?

I'm a backend and mobile developer so web-dev is not my strongest tech skill, however I decided to make this portfolio renewal with some cool tools that I found online.

![React + Vite](public/react+vite.png)

The main tools I used for this project is React+Vite so I can create my custom components using the Material UI style.
