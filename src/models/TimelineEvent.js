I used the Anaconda Spyder IDE (I still think is a mess to understand, but very powerful for what I used it for) and libraries like numpy, matplotlib.

Talking about thech, during this internship I mainly learned about web technologies like Vue and NestJS (they noticed that I\'m more back-end oriented so they mostly gave me API manteinance with NestJS).
